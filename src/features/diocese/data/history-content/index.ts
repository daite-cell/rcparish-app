			'The Catholic Mission in North Arcot dates back to 1604. The following chronicles gathered from various sources will give some historical knowledge of this Mission, its foundation and development in the course of over 350 years. The last great prince of the declining Vijayanagar empire (now in Andhra Pradesh) Venkatapathy Deva Rayalu, conquered the kingdom of vellore in January 1604 and named it Raya Elluru. Elapuri or Elluru in Telugu language would mean city or town. Raya Elluru was ment a town conquered by the king Rayalu and thus the town was named after him-combination of two words Raya and Elapuri.',
			"There were then some Jesuit Fathers at the court of King Rayalu at Chandragiri. He took them also to his new court at Vellore. The word Vellore derives from the Tamil word Vel' which means spear according to another conjecture there were idols of Tamil God 'Murugan' holding Vel in and around Vellore. Vellore was formerly called Velappadi (a place thickly surrounded by a particular tree called 'Velamaram) and for this reason and background the name Vellore came into existence. The Jesuits who had come with their followers here were allowed by the King to build a church within the fort itself, near his court. (This church, though destroyed in 1740, was built again and it is now with the Anglican Church). ",
			'Ancient Jesuit documents show that among these Jesuits, there was one named Fr. Antonious Rubunus, a preacher and confessor, who was commuting between Chandragiri and Vellore. He was sent to Japan on 12 August 1642. On 22 March 1643 he was martyred at Nagasaki. The earliest pioneer of this district had thus, laid the foundation with his blood. In 1610, there was a general upheaval against the Jusuits. It was due to the dishonourable conduct of the Jesuits that their residences both at Chandragiri and at Vellore were suppressed by a Royal Order of the king Philip 111 of Spain and Portugal in 1611.',
			'In a formal way, Christian faith came to the diocese of Vellore towards the last quarter of the 17th century from the Madurai Mission, Fr Andrew Preyre, S.J. seems to have been the first to evangelise Vellore. St. John de Britto and his disciple Fr. Francis Laynis visited Vellore in 1680 and 1683. Fr Francis Laynis, (later Bishop of Mylapore), founded in the year 1683 and 1691 the mission of Koratampet, the first one in the present diocese of Vellore-in the Taluk of Chengarn, North Arcot district-sorne 80 kms south-west of Vellore. In 1699, the first French Jusuit Missionaries settled down at Pondicherry, after closing the Mission of Siam. In 1700, a certain Fr Mandayat began the Jesuit Carnatic Mission at Puliyur, south of Uthiramerur, Chinglepet district like an Indian Sanyasi just as the Fathers of the Madurai Mission did in those days.',

			'Arcot contonment had 484 Catholics, of whom somewere in the light cavalry; Kaveripakkam had three or four Catholic families; Alapakkam about 100 Catholics and Christianpet 13 Families. As the old church a Vellore was too small and in a miserable condition, the site of a local tank bed was bought for RS. 200/ 1847, and the foundation was laid for a new big church. In 1850, Fr Moncourrier of the Paris Foreign Missions built a church and presbytery at Adakambarai on a site given by two Catholics.',

			'On 9 February 1854, the new church at Vellore was solemnly blessed by Mgr Bonnand. After 100 years this church was found in a very bad condition and needed heavy repairs. With a sum of one lakh of rupees it was repaired, extended and remodeled. It served as the Cathedral church of the diocese of Vellore from 1952 Again, this church was further extended with two wings with new concrete slab structure and was consecrated on 3 January 1988 by Cardinal Simon Lourdusamy the prefect of the Congregation for Oriental Churches when Fr. A Nambikairaj was the Parish Priest.',

Archbishop Joseph Morel of Pondicherry (1909-29) and Archbishop Mederlet (1928-34) of Madras were those who played a great role in the formation of the diocese of Vellore in the initial stage.',
			'Among the missionaries of Pondicherry the one who laboured and toiled most indefatigably was Fr Francis Darras who is also called the Apostle of North Arcot. He welcomed into the Church 30,000 persons and founded, several parishes in North Arcot district during 1876-1916. He built the Shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes at Chethupattu in 1896 and a chapel on the hill nearby in 1880. It is now the Shrine of Our Blessed Lady and the biggest center of pilgrimage in the diocese of Vellore.',

			"The Portuguese had control over coastal areas of Tamilnadu and San Thome (Mylapore) in the 16th and the first half of the 17th centuries. Whenever the Portuguese exercised any authority or influence, it was always favourable to the spread of faith. The interior of Tamilnadu was influenced by Mughal ruler Akbar with his friendly attitude to all religions, and similarly by Tirumala Nayak and Queen Mangammal of Madurai and the Kathirava Narasmiah Raj Udayar of Mysore. They all allowed the Christian priests to preach freely in their territories and Christianze the people. The last great prince Venkatapathy Deva Rayalu of vijayanagar conquered the kingdom of Vellore in 1604 and as we mentioned earlier, he kept two Jesuit priests in his court. first at Chandragiri and later at Vellore, and allowed them to build a church at Vellore fort. Unfortunately the first Portuguese Jesuits were called back by king Philip lil for their scandalous life and this hindered evangelizing process. Fr. Rubino wrote to the Jesuit general The Missionaries must adapt themselves to Indian customs. The Period of Renaissance created a spirit of conquest among the Europeans. The period of Reformation certainly helped cleansing the Church structures the clergy, religious and similar organizations from corruption of every kind. Naturally, missionaries who entered India after the above period, were known for their life witness and it was equally a strong factor for Christianity to take solid root in the district of North Arcot Above all, the Master's promise. I will be with you always, to the end of, the Ages (Mt. 28:20), was the strongest guiding force for evangelising endeavours of the missionaries of the area.",
